## Introduce

```
Fundamental Analysis can be little tricky to make model.  
Because it doesn't have general csv format.  
So I fixed it in my apetite

In my view
    generally there are 2 types of fundamental analysis

    1. RAW Fundamental analysis
    2. Price Added Fundamental Analysis

[1] might help you choice better corp.
[2] might help you choice better position.

[2] is more difficult but I think it worth it.
```
- As Fundamental Doesn't have general format / preprocessing required for each model

## v1
- Raw Fundamental Analysis

## v2
- Price Added Fundamental Analysis
